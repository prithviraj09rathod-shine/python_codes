""" Reversing a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in Python is a great exercise in pointer manipulation. Since each node has both next and prev pointers, reversing involves swapping these for every node and updating the head.

ðŸ§  Core Steps
- Traverse the list.
- For each node, swap its next and prev.
- After traversal, update the head to the last processed node.
