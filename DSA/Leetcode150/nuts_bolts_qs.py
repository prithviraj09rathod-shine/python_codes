""" Here's a Python implementation of the Nuts and Bolts matching problem using Quick Sort, where the pivot is chosen as the first element (low) of the array. This version respects the constraint that comparisons can only be made between a nut and a bolt, not nut-to-nut or bolt-to-bolt.

ðŸ§  Core Idea
- Use Quick Sort to match nuts and bolts.
- Pick a nut as pivot to partition bolts.
- Use the matched bolt to partition nuts.
- Recursively match subarrays.
