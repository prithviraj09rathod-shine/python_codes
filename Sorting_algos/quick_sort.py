""" Hereâ€™s a clean and efficient implementation of Quick Sort in Python using the first element (array[low]) as the pivot. This version is great for understanding how partitioning works when the pivot is fixed at the start of the subarray.

Quick Sort Logic (Pivot = arr[low])
- Choose the first element as the pivot.
- Rearrange elements so that:
- All elements less than pivot are on the left.
- All elements greater than pivot are on the right.
- Recursively apply the same logic to left and right subarrays.
